++++++++++++++++++++++++Goals:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++Legibility++++
the main idea behind a stacked graph follows Tufte’s macro/
micro principle [16]: the twin goals are to show many individual
time series, while also conveying their sum. Since the heights of the
individual layers add up to the height of the overall graph, it is pos-
sible to satisfy both goals at once.

	* no spaces between layers -> change in a layer cause change in surronding layer with are not concernd by the changed data
	* Two layers of the same vertical height but with different slopes may appear to have radically different thicknesses --> makes it hard to compare
	+ tradeoff between having the graph to spiky versus the single layers to flat
	* A third issue is the ability of a reader to distinguish effectively the many layers of a stacked graph

	==> all in all hard to read/compare

++++++Aesthetics++++++
Should also be pleasing to look at, but:
some of the aesthetically pleasing—or at least
engaging—qualities may be in conflict with the need for legibility, what sould be weightes more also depends on the audience.

There are four main ingredients that determine a generalized stacked graph.
+ shape of overall shilouete 
he thickness of
the overall stack reflects the sum of the individual time series. Given
this constraint, the overall geometry of the stacked graph is deter-
mined by two factors: the shape of the “baseline,” or bottom of the
lowest layer, and the order of the layers.

+  color choice
choosing a color scheme is highly dependent on the underlying data as well as the context in
which it will be presented beacause: 
Although
color is an opportunity to communicate additional data, strong or
jarring colors become visually distracting and make the graphic
hard to read. At the same time, there must be enough local contrast
between layers in order to differentiate each layer, a particularly
important issue as raised in design issue (E). The design problem is
complicated by the need to balance these perceptual considerations
with aesthetic ones which stem from design issue 
+ labels 

Stacked graphs with a small number of layers
do not necessarily need labels for the layers, since a legend and color
coding scheme may be appropriate
Ideally a label is visually associ-
ated with the data it represents, will not overlap other labels or layers,
and will not distract from the rest of the graphic.

+ ordering of the layers
If there is no intrinsic ordering, he ordering can be chosen to enhance
legibility or to make a better-looking graph. also this wat the disadvangtes of others aspects that reduced for example the legbillityof the graph can be meet.
